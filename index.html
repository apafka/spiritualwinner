  <p>When I just started on my healing journey, my first ayahuasca ceremony, I had no mentors, no real guidance into what I was stepping into and what was about to happen in my life. I had a journal, YouTube, Google and that was pretty much it. I had to learn thrugh extreme trial and error, a lot of pain and suffering, lots of broken relationships, thoughts of suicide and failure. Dark night of the soul was real dark but I came out on the other side full of life, joy, peace, happiness, determination, ambition, love and light. I have a family and I'm going for my WIN! With Spiritual Winner I'll share exactly what you need to know to navigate and integrate your healing process.</p>
