  <p class="header">âœ¨ My dream is to bring back the wisdom of the ancient and indigenous to our modern lifestyle through plant 	medicines, ceremonies, music and technology. Lets connect. âœ¨</a></p>

  <article>
  <p>I share my thoughts regularly on my <a href="https://world.hey.com/pafka">newsletter</a> and welcome emails to <a href="mailto:pafka@hey.com">pafka@hey.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Now</h2>
  <p>Inpsired by Derek Sivers, this is what I'm up to now. I am raising a family, I'm renting out real estate and I am trying to make it by learning to code, building a business, YouTube'ing and writing.</p>

  <h2>Family man</h2>
  <p>I'm married to Jennifer. Together we have three kids - a daughter, a dog and a cat. ðŸ˜Š</p>

  <h2>Spiritual Winner</h2>
  <p>Spiritual Winner is my passion project to help other seeking souls to live a better life by sharing my thoughts about spirituality and plant medicines through audio and video.</p>

  <h2>YouTube and Vlogging</h2>
  <p>I've been vlogging on YouTube for some time now. My initial goals to learn to be a better public speaker, share what I've healed with plant medicines, be as transparent as I possibly had the balls to be and to ship as often as I could.</p>
